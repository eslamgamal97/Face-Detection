# Face-Detection with Deep Learning

A number of deep learning methods have been developed and demonstrated for face detection.

The MTCNN is popular because it achieved then state-of-the-art results on a range of benchmark datasets, and because it is capable of also 
recognizing other facial features such as eyes and mouth, called landmark detection.

The network uses a cascade structure with three networks; first the image is rescaled to a range of different sizes (called an image 
pyramid), then the first model (Proposal Network or P-Net) proposes candidate facial regions, the second model (Refine Network or R-Net) 
filters the bounding boxes, and the third model (Output Network or O-Net) proposes facial landmarks.
